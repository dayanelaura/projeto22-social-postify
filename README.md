# Social Postify
With the increasing presence of companies on social media, having an efficient tool to schedule, manage and track posts on various social media platforms has become indispensable. In this sense, Social Postify comes as a solution for content creators, allowing them to create and schedule posts for different social networks. This allows them to create custom posts with images, titles, text, and choose precise dates and times for each post. The system also provides a clear overview of scheduled posts.
